## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS used variables with colors
- CSS media queries
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project it was my goal to extend my knowledge about media-queries, I used a lot op percentages which seem to work great. 
I wanted to add a nice hover effect on the different price components and bumped into a problem with Safari, for the first time I use -webkit for Safari to get the right hover effect. 
My knowledge of pseudo classes and elements has improved in this project. Nice to work with.

It was a fun project with a nice learning curve.
